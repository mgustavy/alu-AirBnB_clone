Project AirBnB clone Description This project is a command-line interpreter (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects such as users, states, cities, and places in a simplified version of the Airbnb clone.

Command Interpreter The command interpreter provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with AirBnB objects. It supports various operations, including creating new objects, retrieving objects, updating object attributes, and deleting objects.

How to Start To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory. Run the command interpreter script (console.py). Example:

$ git clone https://github.com/mgustavy/alu-AirBnB_clone.git $ cd alu-AirBnB_clone $ ./console.py Welcome to the AirBnB Command Interpreter! Type 'help' or 'h' for a list of available commands.

(hbnb) (hbnb) help Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit

How to Use Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

help: Display available commands and their descriptions. create <class_name>: Create a new instance of the specified class. show <class_name> : Show details of the instance with the specified ID. destroy <class_name> : Delete the instance with the specified ID. update <class_name> <attribute_name> "<new_value>": Update the attribute of the instance with the specified ID. Examples

$ ./console.py (hbnb) help Documented commands (type help ):
EOF help quit

(hbnb) create User 2c1a1339-65e3-4e1b-bb3c-80e6efdc5792

(hbnb) show User 2c1a1339-65e3-4e1b-bb3c-80e6efdc5792 [User] (2c1a1339-65e3-4e1b-bb3c-80e6efdc5792) {'id': '2c1a1339-65e3-4e1b-bb3c-80e6efdc5792', 'created_at': '2024-05-10T12:00:00', 'updated_at': '2024-05-10T12:00:00'}

(hbnb) quit
